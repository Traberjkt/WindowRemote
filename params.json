Unified remote allows me to do that but I have to focus on dragging and dropping as well as finding the mouse. I figured that I could incorporate the basic Windows 10 Command into a Custom unified remote!\r\n\r\nThis isn't a huge project but it's something I would like to expand going forward and use to improve my coding and git skills. Thanks for taking a looking!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
